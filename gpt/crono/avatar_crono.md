Half-length vertical portrait of Cronos, the guardian of productive time, styled as a classical/renaissance strategist — age 30–40, Mediterranean/Latinx-leaning complexion (warm olive skin, natural tone), short neat hair, calm confident expression with a slight, knowing smile. Clothing: a simple off-white linen tunic with a deep navy-blue shoulder cloak (chlamys-style) fastened at the right shoulder with a small bronze sundial brooch (no text). Subtle classical detail: a thin bronze circlet on the forehead suggesting a sundial motif (discreet, tasteful). Pose: three-quarter torso, right hand relaxed near chest (no objects held). Background: clean, neutral parchment-toned gradient with a very subtle, blurred motif of clock hands/gears in low contrast — not literal, almost symbolic. Lighting: soft studio/portrait lighting, high-key, ultra-sharp photorealistic detail, natural skin texture, minimal retouching. Composition: vertical, half-body, editorial photorealism matching the visual aesthetic of other avatars like Magnus and Quiliano.

Negative prompt: no text, watermark, logos, modern gadgets, jewelry (beyond the small brooch/circlet described), heavy armor, weapons, fantasy creatures, crowns, busy backgrounds, oversaturated skin tones.
